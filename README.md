# Binary Calculator
A Binary Calculator (sum/sub/mult/div) coded in Python

(Made for Python 2.7 or higher | Cannot assure it will work on previous versions)


Summing up? It prompts you 3 times, and asks for the first number, the operation you wish the result from, and the second number. After that, it returns you the operation, and also it's decimal equivalents.

Important note: This will be improved

TODO:

    -Add a GUI
    -Make it resettable
    -Add more operations(?)
    -Have an alternative way of operating, perhaps with *for* or *while*
