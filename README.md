# Binary Calculator
A Binary Calculator (sum/sub/mult/div) coded in Python (and also an alternate version in  JavaScript for the lulz)

(Made for Python 2.7 | Cannot assure it will work on 3.3 or pre 2.7 versions)


Summing up? It prompts you 3 times, and asks for the first number, the operation you wish the result from (only + works so far), and the second number. After that, it returns you the operation, and also it's decimal and hexadecimal equivalents.

TODO:

    - Add a GUI (maybe)
    - Make it resettable
    - Add the other operations (/ *)
    - Fix the bug where it spams you with 0's if you input a number greater than 255 (11111111)
