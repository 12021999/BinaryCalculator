# Binary Calculator
A Binary Calculator (sum/sub/mult/div) coded in Python

(Made for Python 2.7 or higher | Cannot assure it will work on previous versions)


Summing up? It prompts you 3 times, and asks for the first number, the operation you wish the result from (only + works so far), and the second number. After that, it returns you the operation, and also it's decimal and hexadecimal equivalents.

Important note: This will be improved

TODO:

    -Add a GUI
    -Make it resettable
    -Add the other operations (- / *)
    -Fix the bug where it spams you with 0's if you input a number greater than 255 (11111111)
